## About
HealthVision AI is designed to provide personalized healthcare insights using state-of-the-art machine learning models. The application covers various health prediction systems, including diabetes, chronic kidney disease, breast cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's disease, and more. Additionally, it offers tools for COVID-19 prediction, endoscopic image classification, diabetic retinopathy detection, Alzheimer's brain classification, and cell segmentation.

## Features
- **Health Prediction Systems:** Predict the likelihood of various health conditions based on user-provided data or uploaded medical images.
- **COVID-19 Prediction:** Input symptoms and relevant details to receive predictions about the likelihood of COVID-19.
- **Endoscopic Image Classification:** Classify endoscopic images into categories such as dyed-lifted-polyps, esophagitis, and more.
- **Diabetic Retinopathy Detection:** Predict the presence of diabetic retinopathy in retinal images.
- **Alzheimer's Brain Classification:** Predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's disease based on brain images.
- **Cell Segmentation:** Visualize cell structures by uploading medical images and viewing segmented cell boundaries.
